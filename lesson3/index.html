        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            Without structure there is no order and a state can quickly become urbanized.We are a one stop reference for
            businesses and the link to the getting where the community needs to be. Bridging the gap between business
            ideas and communityneeds is our focus. We head the functionality of economic developer and planner,
            provide a tourist information center for visitors and locals, business spokesperson, we are the economic
            counselor and
            teacher, and a host of other functions to see
            that growth is seemless for you.

            The Site Map of a site is just like it soundsâ€¦it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related
            and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
            child pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page,
            it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.

            Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the major sections of content that will
            be on the page and the relative locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will be
            6 sections to our page:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation
                bar.</li>
            <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
            <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
            <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
            <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
