       This page welcomes the user to our site in a warm way. It takes them to a very familiar place, their kitchen!
        
        The reason anyone would use my site over using another personâ€™s website is because of the end user experience. 
        The user wants something that is user friendly and that makes it easy for them to navigate. I intend to make this 
        like a locked scroll for the logo bar on the home page which will include banners, logos, and navigation bars/links. 
        I will also note the title of each page so that the user can refer to it to be reminded of what he is currently looking at. 
        I think it will be important to refrain from busy work in my coding as these effects the experience of the user as well. 
        They may be amused at first by the graphics and such, but I recognize that it could be a distraction and take away from 
        what they are trying to do.
